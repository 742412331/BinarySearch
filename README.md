BinarySearch
============
I created a simple console application for the 2nd challenge of Code Kata's series: http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/kata_two_karate.html
More information about binary search: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm

The application implements two algorithms of binary search:

-Iterative algorithm, which uses for loops to check the array for existance of a given element;

-Recursive algorithm, which uses recursion to check both left or right middle of the array for existance of a given element;
